# Project: NY Times Article Clone 
A static page project built for [The Odin Project Ruby on Rails Course](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/html-and-css/lessons/positioning-and-floating-elements) to practice positioning and floating techniques with HTML & CSS. The page mimics the design and flow of [this](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/18/science/space/detection-of-waves-in-space-buttresses-landmark-theory-of-big-bang.html?_r=0) article from the New York Times. Encouraged to use Flexbox and Grid, however not limited to those techniques. 

## Features 
This is a close remake, but not exact copy. Similar fonts were used due to the copyrights on the original New York Times fonts used on their website. All links and buttons are not linked to other pages, as the exercise was focused on the visual aspects rather than the function.
